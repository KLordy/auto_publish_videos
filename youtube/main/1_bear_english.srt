The way this polar bear walks is a bit casual because it knows the physics of walking on ice.

2
00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:04.720
casual because it knows the physics of walking on ice.

3
00:00:07.749 --> 00:00:07.759
To prevent the ice from breaking,

4
00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559
the bear has increased the lying surface area so

5
00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:14.829
that the pressure on the weight of the place on the ice is reduced.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520
It is done
